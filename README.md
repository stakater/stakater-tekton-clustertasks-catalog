# tekton-catalog

This repository contains a catalog of Cluster Task resources, which are designed to be reusable in many pipelines.

Each Task is provided in a separate directory along with a README.md and a Helm Chart, so you can choose which Tasks to install on your cluster. A directory can hold one task and multiple version.
